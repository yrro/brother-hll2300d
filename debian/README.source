Certain components of Brother's driver are only available in the form of
executables compiled for i386. Therefore, in order to build the package on an
amd64 machine, you will have to configure your system for multiarch by running
`dpkg --add-architecture i386` followed by `apt update`. Finally, install
`build-essential:i386`. You are now ready to proceed.

The following command will build both the source package and binary packages in one go:

	dpkg-buildpackage --host-arch=i386 --hook-source='debian/rules get-orig-source && mv *.orig-*.tar.* ..'
