Brother HL-L2300D drivers for Debian
====================================

After installing the package, a printer can be configured from the CUPS web
interface, or by hand:

1. Run `lpinfo -m` to identify a model for the printer
2. Run `lpinfo -v` to identify a URL for the printer
3. Create the printer with `lpadmin -p foo -m model -v url`

How the drivers work
--------------------

1. CUPS looks for \*cupsFilter inside the PPD file, which directs it to
   `brother_lpdwrapper_HLL2300D`.
2. CUPS runs this filter as documented in filter(7). The filter runs
   `brprintconflsr3` (what this does is uncertain) and then pipes the input job
   through `filter_HLL2300D` (henceforth known as the LPD filter).
3. The LPD filter processes the job with GhostScript, piping the output
   through `rawtobr3`.

Testing the drivers
-------------------

$ cupsfilter -p /usr/share/ppd/brother/brother-HLL2300D-cups-en.ppd -m printer/foo -e test.ps > out

According to file(1), `out` will contain PJL data.
